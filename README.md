# Surfs Up Milkshake and Surf Shop

## Overview of the Analysis
For this analysis I have been asked to analyze weather data for June and December of 2016 to determine the viability and success of building a surf and milkshake shop on Oahu.

## Results:

To highlight some of the key differences, we can look at the minimum, maximum, and average temperatures for the months of December and June, as well as the total counts:

### June Temperature Results

Here we see that for the month of June:
* The minimum temperature was 64
* The maximum temperature was 85
* The average temperature was 75

### December Temperature Results

Here we see that for the month of December:
* The minimum temperature was 56
* The maximum temperature was 83
* The average temperature was 71

* The count for June is 1700 while December's count is 1517

## Summary:
From the results we can see that, aside from some of the lower days in December, most of the temperatures for June and December are well withing an acceptable range for beach attendance. Which shows that this buisiness venture has the potential to be successfull year-round.
By checking the counts for both months it tells us that overall June had a higher number of warmer days than December
On average the percentages for both months only differ by 2-4 percenatge points, which again shows that this has the potential to be a successful venture. 
I recommed taking into consideration the precipitation for each month as this will affect the amount of foot traffic on the beach. As well as getting a detailed analysis of the weather for each day of the month to help determine if a short closure could be beneficial during the colder rainer month.
