Here we see that for the month of December:
* The minimum temperature was 58
* The maximum temperature was 87
* The average temperature was 73

To highlight some of the key differences, we can look at the count and percentiles:

* The count for June is 2759 while December's count is 1604

The percentiles for June are as follows:
* 25%  72
* 50%  76
* 75%  78

The percentiles for December are as follows:
* 25%  70
* 50%  74
* 75%  74
There is a bulleted list that addresses the three key differences in weather between June and December. (6 pt)

## Summary:
From the results we can see that the minimum, maximum, and average temperatures for June and December are almost identical. Which shows that this buisiness venture had the potential to be successfull year-round.
By checking the counts for both months it tells us that overall June had a higher number of warmer days than December
On average the percentages for both months only differ by 1 to 2 percenatges, which again shows that this has the potential to be a successful venture. 
I recommed taking into consideration the precipitation for each month as this will affect the amount of foot traffic on the beach. As well as getting a detailed analysis of the weather for each day of the month to help determine if a short closure could be beneficial during the colder rainer month.
